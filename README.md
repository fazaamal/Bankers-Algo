<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>
Our Application implements a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm also reffered to as the "Bankers Algorithm". The program will read from an input .txt file that contains the maximum and allocation matrix of a six different threads then proced to run a Safety algorithm on the input and output the order in which the threads can execute in a safe state. The program will then output the result from the following requests: 

1. Request from Thread 1 arrives for (1, 0, 2)
2. Request from Thread 4 arrives for (3, 3, 0)
3. Request from Thread 0 arrives for (0, 2, 0)

<h2 align="center">How to Compile and Run the Code</h2>

* **Step 1 : Download The Source Code** : Download and save the compressed source file Bankers-Algo-main.zip. Once download, extract the file to your choose file destination 
* **Step 2 : Compile the Executable Code** : Compile and Link (aka Build) the source code "inFile.cpp" into executable code ("infile.exe" in Windows or "inFile" in UNIX/Linux/Mac)
  - On IDE (such as CodeBlocks), push the "Build" button.
  - On Text editor with the GNU GCC compiler, start a CMD Shell (Windows) or Terminal (UNIX/Linux/Mac) and issue these commands: 
  
    ```
    // Windows (CMD shell) - Build "inFile.cpp" into "inFile.exe"
    > g++ -o inFile.exe inFile.cpp
 
    // UNIX/Linux/Mac (Bash shell) - Build "inFile.cpp" into "inFile"
    $ g++ -o inFile inFile.cpp
    }
    ```
* **Step 3 : Run the Executable Code** : Execute (Run) the program.
  - On IDE (such as CodeBlocks), push the "Run" button.
  - On Text Editor with GNU GCC compiler, issue these command from CMD Shell (Windows) or Terminal (UNIX/Linux/Mac):
  
    ```
    // Windows (CMD shell) - Run "inFile.exe" 
    > inFile
